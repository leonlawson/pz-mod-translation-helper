A swim on a barge, at which a concert is held for the deceased this year. I need to conduct it with some girl, like an entertainer. The girl handed out plasticine robots to all the spectators and they started to chew them, but it turned out that the concert was just a cover, and that all these people were gathered here so that there was an opportunity to climb around their houses, where the funeral is going on. di is everywhere in the house, all sad, in black, the coffin is standing in. I find a ring in a designated place and climb into a garbage bag, everyone behind me, of course, shouting “How did you get here!?!?, and I'm already on the other end In the end, I collect everything and return the same way to the barge, the girl leading, suddenly rushes to the wall and destroys everything, I find myself on the shore, along with a huge white elk in a white T-shirt with yellow stripes on the sleeves. The moose is molded of plastic or something similar, and a small toy boat was lying on the back. I walk along the shore, I think where should I go next - this moose is clearly not an adviser. I return to the boat, pick it up, and it turned out to be an exact small copy of that barge. On the wall where the girl jumped was a small silhouette carved on a tree. She is full-length and points a finger somewhere. I look where she points a finger. It turned out that in that direction is a residential area and smoke rises from some building. I go to the houses, the moose with me. I go to a four-story building with smoke, I understand that this is a school, it is locked and there is panic. We climb up with the elk along the fire escape to the very top. The roof is on. In the windows I see that the guys at school have a uniform - white tracksuits with yellow stripes. I say moose -Your way out, man, task for you! And he is standing, looking at me. Fashioned from something, even fingerprints remained on it. I think - Fool. I take off his shirt and put it on the window. The moose remained on the street. I go into the room, like a circus arena, round. There is a meeting. Everyone is intimidated, everyone knows something. I jump onto the stage, grab the microphone and start talking. I am entertaining a little, relaxing the audience, I feel this excitement and at the same time I am watching all the spectators, they are in my palm. One strange mikimaus alerted me and a man who looks at me in horror and whispers something. I take him to the stage, give the microphone and make everyone say that he knows. Comforting him. - All of their own and everyone wants to know ... He tells me. - You are the one! Who, I say, is the same ?? Well, the one about which they warned! It turns out that some woman who set fire to the roof so that everyone would get scared and run away scared me all around. Everyone was waiting for me. I recall that even before the concert for the dead they explained to me that there is some kind of woman who can destroy everyone if the doors are closed. I need to neutralize it and prevent everything. What does it mean: if the doors are closed, they did not explain to me. I try to calm people and gently grab mycimaus. I rip off a plush costume from him, there was another mycimaus - as if alive, moves, looks at me, rips off this costume from him. There is mycimaus there again, only of smaller stature. A couple more times, and I get to the little battery-powered electric bug. Meanwhile, everything began to crumble. I disassemble the beetle for spare parts and lose a lot of time. I start to bring out the frightened people, and I see how in the distance, between the schoolchildren in white suits, the very girl flashed who closes the doors. She crawled behind me in a trash bag in one of the houses ... I followed her. ... ... From the found tools, a device was assembled with which you can jump into some kind of kindergarten in which I am a child, and she is a teacher. She knew that I was in one of the children, but did not know which one. Everything is precisely designed to press it against a wall in a room filled with children's picture books. It turned out as a result of the conversation that she was told that I was an enemy, that everyone next to me was dying when I open the doors, and that she needed to save people from me .. They gathered all the people, put them in the elevator and drove down to where safely. As soon as everyone got out of the bodice and the doors began to close, an old man flew in by helicopter and said that we were great, did the job. I understand that the elevator doors opened with me, and now they will close with her, with the girl, and everything will explode. I hold the elevator doors, and the old man in a helicopter laughs. The girl is crying, everyone is running in different directions ... ",

Which is not at all like her current home. But for some reason I’m not with Natasha anymore, but either with Olga, or with someone else. And we understand that all over the world some kind of monster invasion has begun. <LINE> <LINE> We go into the house, and there Natasha goes down the stairs with someone and she is completely indifferent to what is happening. It is very strange, as if she were zombied. We went up to another floor, and began to look at what was happening below, from a window on the landing. And down there, the aliens take everyone who leaves the house. But they do not look like monsters - they were just a crowd of strange people. <LINE> <LINE> And here I am again with Natasha. We decided to try to get out of the house. We go down ... <LINE> <LINE> We lie under some bush. Hid. We see how on the huge screens on the street they broadcast what is happening in the world. First they show some man - politics. One of the main ones. Aliens did something terrible to him. Then they show how all the newborn is now branded - they put a round sign with a strange pattern inside on the right buttock. After that, I understand that I’m just being taken to sleep ... <LINE> <LINE> I wake up from the fact that one of the aliens discovered me. Natasha is not around. Oddly enough, he looks like an ordinary human guy. He leads me somewhere. We go, and I think that, here, a meteorite fell, and aliens came after it. And for me it is logical and real! Following him, I make some kind of table in my head. I think that when I fill it, the dream will end, but I manage to fill in only two fields in the table. <LINE> <LINE> We continue to walk along the street, in front of the restaurant, large round tables in the open. I stopped next to a man. He called me, and the one who led me said nothing. This man from the restaurant gave me a drink of his glass of something bright - it looks like it's champagne. But after drinking, I do not feel the taste. Then he handed me a small glass on his leg. It has a scarlet liquid. It shimmers in different shades. I think this is liquor ... it will be delicious now. The liquid turned out to be of an ugly taste - some kind of bitter-salty, with an incomprehensible aftertaste ... ",

A swim on a barge, at which a concert is held for the deceased this year. I need to lead it with some man, like an entertainer. The man gave plasticine robots to all the spectators and they started to chew them, but it turned out that the concert was just a cover, and that all these people were gathered here so that there was an opportunity to climb around their houses, where the funeral is going on. and everywhere in the house, everything is sad, in black, the coffin is standing in. I find a ring in a designated place and climb into a garbage bag, everyone behind me, of course, shouting “How did you get here!?!?, and I'm already on the other end In the end, I collect everything and return the same way to the barge, the lead man suddenly rushes to the wall and destroys everything, I find myself on the shore, along with a huge white elk in a white T-shirt with yellow stripes on the sleeves. The moose is molded of plastic or something similar, and a small toy boat was lying on the back. I walk along the shore, I think where should I go next - this moose is clearly not an adviser. I return to the boat, pick it up, and it turned out to be an exact small copy of that barge. On the wall where the man jumped was a small silhouette carved on a tree. He is full-length and points a finger somewhere. I look where he points his finger. It turned out that in that direction is a residential area and smoke rises from some building. I go to the houses, the moose with me. I go to a four-story building with smoke, I understand that this is a school, it is locked and there is panic. We climb up with the elk along the fire escape to the very top. The roof is on. In the windows I see that the guys at school have a uniform - white tracksuits with yellow stripes. I say moose -Your way out, man, task for you! And he is standing, looking at me. Fashioned from something, even fingerprints remained on it. I think - Fool. I take off his shirt and put it on the window. The moose remained on the street. I go into the room, like a circus arena, round. There is a meeting. Everyone is intimidated, everyone knows something. I jump onto the stage, grab the microphone and start talking. I am entertaining a little, relaxing the audience, I feel this excitement and at the same time I am watching all the spectators, they are in my palm. One strange mikimaus alerted me and a man who looks at me in horror and whispers something. I take him to the stage, give the microphone and make everyone say that he knows. Comforting him. - All of their own and everyone wants to know ... He tells me. - You are the one! Who, I say, is the same ?? Well, the one about which they warned! It turns out that there was a man who visited me and frightened everyone, who set fire to the roof so that everyone would be scared and scatter. Everyone was waiting for me. I recall that even before the concert for the dead they explained to me that there is some kind of man who can destroy everyone if the doors are closed. I need to neutralize it and prevent everything. What does it mean: if the doors are closed, they did not explain to me. I try to calm people and gently grab mycimaus. I rip off a plush costume from him, there was another mycimaus - as if alive, moves, looks at me, rips off this costume from him. There is mycimaus there again, only of smaller stature. A couple more times, and I get to the little battery-powered electric bug. Meanwhile, everything began to crumble. I disassemble the beetle for spare parts and lose a lot of time. I start to withdraw the frightened people, and I see how in the distance, between the schoolchildren in white suits, the same man flashed by who closes the doors. He climbed after me into a garbage bag in one of the houses ... I followed him. ... ... From the found tools, a device was assembled with which you can jump into some kind of kindergarten, in which I am a child, and he is a teacher. He knows that I am in one of the children, but does not know which one. Everything is precisely designed to press it against a wall in a room filled with children's picture books. It turned out as a result of the conversation that he was told that I was an enemy, that everyone next to me was dying when I open the doors, and that he needed to save people from me .. They gathered all the people, put them in the elevator and drove down to where safely. As soon as everyone got out of the bodice and the doors began to close, an old man flew in by helicopter and said that we were great, did the job. I understand that the elevator doors opened with me, and now they will close with him, with a man, and everything will explode. I hold the elevator doors, and the old man in a helicopter laughs.
