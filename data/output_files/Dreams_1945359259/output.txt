The interior matches the exterior, old, twisted, rusty metal. My attention was attracted by a strange hole in the wall, light seeps out of this hole, the light does not look like the light of the sun, I risk going through it and find myself standing in the square in front of the station. Where I am? The box had no railroad tracks leading to or from it, and in the desert around the canyon there was no city or railroad. I am the only soul for miles .. I hear the bell rang, the doors to the station swing open, and the square is filled with people ... <LINE> <LINE> A woman comes up to me, dressed in a big green dress with a big hat to match the dress ... I'm trying to get answers from her. I wanted to know where we were, and then I saw her face, her skin made of fabric, she is white, lacy, with soft stripes going down her face and body, her full lips with red lipstick. I don't remember her eyes, but I believe they matched her dress. all those details ... but her words made her ugly. I don't understand what she is saying to me, but I know that she is rude to me...",

Out of the window I peer, no shamblers, no rotting flesh, just people minding their own business. I don’t understand. How did I get into my old bed? I was in my bunker. I spent nearly a year building that place deep in the forest, away from all those walking dead. This must be a dream, a sick dream from the time before. I got to wake up, I got to shock myself awake, I got to jump out my window and shock myself awake! Oh got it hurts, the pavement hurts! Help me… Waking up in the hospital bandaged everywhere, not again! I cannot wake up from this dream. I press the button that calls for assistance. Where are the Zombies, what is going on?! What do you mean you don’t know what I am talking about?! I won’t calm down! I won’t stop, let go! I pull free and run out of the hospital. No, no stop the car… I cannot believe all the blood coming out of me!

Now, I am going to take them out. Look at them all fall! It feels so real. If only in real life I can be this calm, it will be so easy. I must have finished off a couple of dozen of them, nice! I look around, it looks like I am back at home. Lucid dreaming gives you courage, that is for sure. Everything is fading away, I must be waking up. I look at my feet. All bloody and muddy.

I should have given myself to you way before, but now… This is the way it should be, the way nature made us… compatible. Once we are happy together, I will help you! I won’t be holding you back anymore. We will love everyone, together. Isn’t that the real beauty of life, to love everyone? No discrimination? I feel it, I am in your embrace.

Next to the turntable, on the TV, there are several cassettes - so I have a marathon of films. There is an extension cord on my bed, with wires from the TV inserted into it. Everything would be fine, but I remember that in this attic, on the opposite side from the exit, a little further from the TV, right in front of the window, there is a sculpture of an angel, looking somewhere to the left, holding his hands in a prayer position. The body of the sculpture is turned towards me. Suddenly I realize that the sculpture will follow me - if they turn away ... <LINE> <LINE> This is not just a sculpture, it is also an animatronic! Cyclic movement of the head - first there is a slow lifting up, then, slow and smooth blinking, the next movement of the head down, blinking again ... everything repeats again in a circle ... <LINE> <LINE> I remember that from the wall, to the left, behind the TV are mannequins, there are quite a few of them, about 6. The angel statue is now facing them. All animated !!! They have no faces, they are all white. First, they make a smooth bow to each other, and then they make some kind of body movements with their hands. <LINE> <LINE> - How cool they are! <LINE> <LINE> All movements are smooth and beautiful, as if they are alive. Explicit work of the master. <LINE> <LINE> I look at the sculptures for a while, the plot on TV - from the usual dialogue, switches to a moment that is alarming for the plot. For a moment, my gaze turns to the bed on which I am sitting - the extension cord has disappeared somewhere. I look at the face of the statue ... she looks in my direction again - the movements are the same, lifting my head, blinking ... I start to worry a little ... I hear the sound of switching off ... the TV screen goes blank. In the hands of the statue I see an extension cord, with disconnected wires. <LINE> <LINE> I call my parents, it seems they are nearby ... <LINE> <LINE> With a frightened intonation, I tell them what just happened to me. <LINE> <LINE> They are listening carefully. I point to a statue with its head turned somewhere to the left, its eyes are closed, hands are in a prayer position ... neither the statue nor the mannequins make any movements ... these are just standing figures. <LINE> <LINE> I look at the bed - on it lies the same extension cord with the wires pulled out.

All the street lights flickered, then went out. Suddenly, the darkness was almost overwhelming. There were no stars to be seen overhead. The city seemed to have disappeared from oblivion. <LINE> <LINE> Then noise appeared. It was like music, but it came from everywhere and nowhere. It seemed to bounce off every building and street corner, but I can't tell where it's coming from. <LINE> <LINE> Finally, I hear a click. Weak at first, but every next one gets louder and louder. I can feel its echoes in the very ground on which I stand. Then, in the blink of an eye, the lights came on again, the noise disappeared, and the city came alive again. <LINE> <LINE> I look around in confusion, wondering what just happened.

He was still far away from me, but it is clear that he is developing at a breakneck speed... Everything happened very quickly. I heard and see how the car reached its maximum speed and headed straight for me. My body trembled, and I realized that my car would not be able to dodge and avoid a collision. And then I hear a blow and feel thousands of metal hands that suddenly grabbed me and pierced my body. I open my eyes, the front part is completely destroyed, the doors are blocked, I can’t pull the handle, it just isn’t in its place, everything is filled with broken glass, blood smeared all over the car interior.

We need to fold them nicely, neatly... Here, it's better.... The pile is already quite large, some measures need to be taken.

I start to get desperate, wanting to find some food. Then, out of nowhere, I notice a bright light in the distance. It seems to be calling me like a beacon of hope. I follow the light, and eventually I come to a small diner. The diner is old but cozy, the air is filled with the smell of freshly cooked food.
