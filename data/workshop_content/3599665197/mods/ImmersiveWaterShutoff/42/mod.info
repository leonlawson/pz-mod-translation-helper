modversion=1.0.8
description=Adds sandbox options for a more immersive water shutoff experience. By default, the mod removes all remaining water from faucets, baths, and other containers once the central water supply is turned off, while keeping water in toilets. You can customize or completely disable this behavior in the sandbox settings, including an option to reduce water randomly instead of removing it entirely. Based on an initial concept by DaNiG.
