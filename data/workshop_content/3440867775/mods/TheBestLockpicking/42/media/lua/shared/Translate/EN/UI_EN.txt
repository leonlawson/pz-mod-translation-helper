By putting the key in, <RGB:FF0000>driver pins</RGB> align at the edge of <RGB:0101F4>the lock cylinder</RGB> and the lock gets unbound.<br>By turning it, it unlocks. With a wrong key <RGB:FF0000>driver pins</RGB> won't get aligned, the lock doesn't get unbind and turning the key won't be possible."

Lockpicking separates rotational force and pin alignment goals into different tools.<br>Rotation force is handled by <RGB:0101F4>the tension bar</RGB> and pin alignment handled by <RGB:FF4F1D>the picker</RGB>.<br>These two tools must be used together to compensate for the fact that they can't align all the pins at the same time as a key does.<br>Since it is hard to see small changes in tension we will use this tension meter to visualize the amount of tension applied.<br>When the rotational force is applied to a lock with <RGB:0101F4>a tension bar</RGB>, pins get stuck by a particular order called <RGB:42B18D>binding order</RGB>. The order is determined by imperfections of the lock mechanism.<br><RGB:E9BE45>Binding pin</RGB> is the one that you should set other pins. This also fits the <RGB:42B18D>binding order</RGB> as it should be.<br>When too much tension is applied, current <RGB:E9BE45>binding pin</RGB> will be the first one to get <RGB:FF0000>stuck</RGB>. <RGB:FF0000>Stuck pins</RGB> don't move.<br>Once enough tension is applied and the pin is lifted by <RGB:FF4F1D>picker</RGB> to correct position. <RGB:00FF00>Pin gets set</RGB> with a click sound. After this next pin in <RGB:42B18D>binding order</RGB>, will be <RGB:E9BE45>binding pin</RGB>.<br>As pins get set, tension needs to be raised for the next <RGB:E9BE45>binding pin</RGB> to respond.<br>If tension gets too low, <RGB:00FF00>set pins</RGB> and <RGB:FF0000>stuck pins</RGB> will start to fall according to <RGB:42B18D>binding order</RGB> with a click.<br>When all pins set the lock becomes unbound and it can be opened by further rotating the <RGB:0101F4>tension bar</RGB> (increasing tension).<br>Every lock has its own <RGB:42B18D>binding order</RGB> and it wouldn't change the second time you pick the same lock."

With a low lockpicking skill, your hands will tremble, which can subsequently lead to excessive tension. Too much tension can break your tools!<br>Move the mouse to lift each pin. Listen for a click when it sets correctly.<br>When all pins are set, you can open the lock by increasing the tension to the end."

While this amount is always the same, it's place changes according to pin.<br>Another way to overcome this is keeping <RGB:FF0000>mushroom pin</RGB> above its neck."
