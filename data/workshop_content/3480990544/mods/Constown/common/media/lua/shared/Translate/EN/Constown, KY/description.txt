<CENTRE> <SIZE:medium> CONSTOWN <LINE> <LINE>
<LEFT> <SIZE:small> This is a small town in Knox County, the center of which is pierced by a four-lane highway, which is the main source of income for local residents. Any traveler passing through the town can stay at our wonderful “Summer tree” motel. <LINE> <LINE> And if your car suddenly breaks down, there are two auto repair shops along the highway where you can inexpensively repair your vehicle. <LINE> <LINE> Unfortunately, time makes its own adjustments and small businesses are unable to compete with large entrepreneurs. Therefore, in Constown you can find restaurants and shops that have recently been the pearls of the city, closed forever. <LINE> <LINE> But despite the fact that now is not the most favorable period, Constown is a town where you want to stay!
