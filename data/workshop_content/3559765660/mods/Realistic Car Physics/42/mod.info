description=Realistic Car Physics overhauls the car engine and drivetrain physics. It adds support for burnouts, locking up the rear wheels while braking and redlining the engine in every gear with an accurately simulated automatic transmission among other things. It requires a manual install of the "zombie" folder to your "ProjectZomboid" directory.
