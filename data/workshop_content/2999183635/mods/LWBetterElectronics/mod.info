description= Aimed on giving the Electronics Skill a Purpose on Higher Levels. To get easier to higher Levels one can find an Electronics Kit for Practicing (which needs materials). Adds Recipes for better Noise Generators, High-Range Remotes, Motion Sensors, as well as a Recipe to scavenge Electronics Scrap for Components and more. Futher adds recipes for upgrading Radios and Walkie-Talkies. All recipes need to be found in Magazines of course. High-Level Electricians actually can craft them too.     I am planning to implement Stuff like Noiseless Generators with a higher Range, Solar Panels, Wind Generators and more automated Stuff in the future if I have time.
