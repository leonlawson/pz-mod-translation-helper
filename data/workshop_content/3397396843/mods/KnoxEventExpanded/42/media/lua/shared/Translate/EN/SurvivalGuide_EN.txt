    " <TEXT> When you enter a save with the mod for the first time, you will be presented with the procedural generation map. This map looks identical to the normal world map, with the difference that it displays all houses inhabited by npcs as red.<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> In the top center, you will find the current stats. They are updated live while the simulation is running to show you some stats for all npcs.<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> To the left are the settings for the simulation, as well as the control buttons (start, stop, and reset) at the bottom.<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> Some settings and what they mean:<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> 1. The settings under general control the initial couples at the start of the simulation along with how many kids they can have, and their ages.<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> 2. Pregnancy chance - any female NPC's chance of becoming pregnant every month if they are married.<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> 3. Friend chance - Any NPC's chance to befriend another npc.<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> 4. Date chance - Any single NPC's chance to date and/or marry another NPC that is single.<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> <CENTRE> <SIZE:medium> Job and crime:<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> NPCs with a job will work and gain wealth for their family, as well as gain xp in skills relevant to their jobs.<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> In addition to working, NPCs have a risk of losing their job, controlled by Job loss risk. Once they lose their job, they will either turn more immoral, controlled by Crime rate, turn to a life of crime, controlled by Morality cutoff, or find a new job, controlled by Job find chance.<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> If a NPC becomes a criminal, they will try to do crime. Which crime they try to do is random, and if they happen to get caught, they can end up in jail.<BR><BR>"..
    " <TEXT> <CENTRE> <SIZE:medium> Where are the npcs? <BR>"..
    " <TEXT> If you are not getting tons of errors, the mod should be working. The npcs in the mod are different in the sense that they do not "orbit" you. They are distributed all over the map depending on the zombie intensity in that area. Aside from that, the npcs (currently) follow a schedule where they patrol around their house and rest during the day, and only rest during the night. The easiest way to find them is to use a walkie-talkie (portable two-way radio) and use the 'Contact nearby survivors'-option. It will mark npc safehouses on your map.<BR><BR>"..
    " <TEXT> <CENTRE> <SIZE:medium> Why can't I attack the NPCs? <BR> <TEXT> The way the mod is implemented, you will automatically be able to attack NPCs that are hostile towards you.<BR>"..
    "To override this, there is a red icon to the left of the screen with two crossed axes and a lock. That means PvP is off i.e. you cannot attack the npcs. Pressing the icon or pressing G will enable PvP. The hotkey, G, can also be changed in options.<BR><BR>"..
    " <TEXT> <CENTRE> <SIZE:medium> What is "relationship"? <BR> <TEXT> Npcs have relationship with you and other npcs they encounter (or have encountered). It is a number between -100 and 100 that controls how much they like you or other npcs. The number itself is a sum of all positive and negative memories a npc has about another npc. Having good conversations with npcs typically increases relationship while insulting them or fighting them decreases it. These effects all fade over time as well. Some npcs e.g. soldiers will always see you as hostile (for now).<BR><BR>"..
    " <TEXT> <CENTRE> <SIZE:medium> Are there hostile npcs? <BR>"..
    " <TEXT> By default there are hostile npcs generated during procedural generation. <BR>"..
    " <TEXT> Some of these npcs will be in prison when the Knox Event begins. They will then escape and try to return home, hence they can be identified by their orange jumpsuits. Other criminals happen to not be in jail at the time of the Knox Event.<BR>"..
    " <TEXT> Hostile NPCs will currently only try to rob you. They will turn aggressive you if you hit them, or try to run away. They can also try to raid your base if they happen to find it.<BR><BR>"..

    " <TEXT> You can ask a npc to join you by right-clicking them and selecting the "Speak" option. Under the suboption "About their group", you can either ask them to join your group, or ask if their entire group wants to join. <BR> If they don't accept, the peaceful option is to speak with them regularly, until they decide to join you. Beware, they don't take kindly being asked to join you too often. If you want a more violent route, you can opt to take out some of the group members to increase the chance of them joining you.<BR><BR>"..

    " <TEXT> NPCs will clear corpses from inside the corpse clear zone(s), and dump them in the corpse dump zone. Although it might work somewhat, it is not recommended to have the corpse clear and the corpse dump zones overlap.
