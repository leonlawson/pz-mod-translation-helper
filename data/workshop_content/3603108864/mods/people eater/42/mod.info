description= The jewel of Gas City, from the wasteland, is now here on these streets. If you hook it up to its main trailer, you have a mobile gas station with an enormous capacity, based on the 1980 Mercedes-Benz W123 limousine mounted on a truck. It's almost unstoppable, able to pass through hordes of zombies without a problem, but watch your tires and the game's physics.
