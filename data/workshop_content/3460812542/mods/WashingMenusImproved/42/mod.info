description=More flexible washing menus than the vanilla option to wash "all clothing" (which was unusable when there wasn't enough water for all clothing in your inventory). Wash clothing and gear from inventory or equipped bags, even with limited water. Detailed tooltips, smart sorting, automatic transfers from backpacks, and support for all water sources on the ground. The submenu "Clean Rags" has compact submenus with options to clean dirty bandages, rags, denim strips, and leather scraps.
