Originally named "Liu Ba Tou," Willowbrook Bastion! served as the station for the 7th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade of the New Fourth Army's 1st Division during the Anti-Japanese War. Hu Shiyan, editor of the regiment's Combat News, wrote the novel The Story of Willowbrook Bastion! here, depicting the close bond between the military and civilians. The story was later adapted into a film of the same name, leading to the town's renaming as "Willowbrook Bastion!."
